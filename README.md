# dbc: database (acebase) client

This is just a sandbox to play with using [AceBase](https://github.com/appy-one/acebase/) as a persistent store in a SvelteKit app. It took me a minute to get AceBase up and running, mainly because it's a new-to-me storage and sync model, but this should serve as a template for further experiments.
